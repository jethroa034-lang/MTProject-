    <h2>Old Houses of San Nicolas</h2>
    <p>
      Walking through the town, you’ll find charming <b>ancestral houses</b> that reflect the Spanish colonial influence of centuries past. 
      These old structures, made of red bricks and hardwood, are a testament to the town’s architectural heritage and Ilocano craftsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these homes, located near the town center and church, were built during the Spanish era and have stood the test of time.
      Their distinctive clay-tiled roofs, capiz-shell windows, and strong brick foundations serve as living reminders of San Nicolas’s rich history.
